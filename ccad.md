### Running on DCEG CCAD cluster (SGE)


#### Prepare the pipeline

- activate the snakemake conda environment created in the installation step 

```conda activate snakemake```

- clone the repository

modify ```config/samples.txt``` and ```config/config.yaml``` as described in [here](inputs_and_outputs.md)


- go to workflow directory

```cd <cloned repo dir>/workflow```

- create a script that looks like this

```
#!/bin/bash

module load singularity

snakemake  --profile profiles/ccad --use-singularity --singularity-args "--bind /DCEG" --jobs 100 --latency-wait 300 --rerun-incomplete
```

- submit the script 

	```qsub -q long.q -V -j y -cwd -o ${PWD} <script>```

- monitor the jobs

	```qstat```

- The log files are in ```<cloned repo dir>/workflow/logs/```, it is also useful to look at ```<cloned repo dir>/workflow/<script>.o<jobid>``` for snakemake logs
